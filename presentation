SSH - Secure Shell
# SSH is secure shell, a protocol which is wildly used in current era. From git to remote connections.

whoami ?

OpenSSH - OpenBSD Secure Shell
# A suite of SSH utilites. Our main point of discussion today.
# Found in most Linux/Mac OS by default.
# ASSUME: Preconfigured ssh server
# Let's connect

$ ssh user@hostname
# Let's see what I can do.
# I can.... basically do anything. I've entire control to the device.

TRY IT

$ ssh wos@52.47.163.42
#< CONNECT TO PARIS >


# Let's try connecting to my phone
Android Shell
$ ssh -i android.pem u0_a185@ip_address -p 2222
# Here are a few things to this command. I'll come back to this later on.
# First, let's enjoy

$ am start --user 0 -n com.android.calculator2/.Calculator
# A calculator popups up. The audience cheers in joy. The whole auditorim is lit up

$ ssh -i android.pem u0_a185@ip_address -p 2222
$ ssh -i KEY USER@ip_address -p PORT

Public Key Authentication

-p 2222 i.e. port 2222

$ ssh -i android.pem u0_a185@ip_address -p 2222
# Now, I guess this command makes a lot more sense!

SSH can work as a proxy

$ ssh -TD 4711 user@host

-T: Don't need a terminal
-D: Enable proxy on following local port

Neo has has full fleged GUI installation in Paris

Remote Desktop / RDP ?

But he only knows SSH

SSH X11 Forwarding
# The X is reponsible for all the GUI on you Linux based operating system.
# (What is X? : https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/276168/what-is-x11-exactly)
# Yes, SSH can forward that too.
# NOTE: Heavy bandwidth, use VNC

Using the GUI, Neo has retrived data to develop a secret website
The website shares data available near Mach 0.
# He wants to use this for some secret communications.
# Cannot trasfer the website, as it needs to be hosted near Mach 0
# Cannot host it on his current computer, the machines would detect location and kill him

Any idea ?
# Send via live chat.

SSH Port Forwarding
# SSH can forward remote ports to local and vice versa

$ ssh -R 1337:localhost:80 user@host

Connection -> remote:1337 -> local -> localhost:80
# Of course, reverse is also possible
# TODO: Develop website

The data is being captured from Mach0 and transmitted
Pat yourselves on the back
# Neo keeps going on

SSH Configuration file
# Comes very handly to save SSH details

~/.ssh/config

@img/config.png
# Let's write one config for our paris server
# DO: Write config W/O Key

Still gotta write the password though

Remember Public/Private key ?

Let's add one
# DO: ssh-keygen on paris
# 	: authorized_hosts

[wos@paris .ssh]$ ssh-keygen
[wos@paris .ssh]$ cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys


@img/needprivkey.png

File Transfer: SCP
# SSH can transfer files too!!

$ scp paris:~/.ssh/id_rsa paris_key
# Add key to config

Doesn't work?

PRIVATE KEY (paris_key): strict access
authorized_keys: strict access

$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/paris_key
[wos@paris ~]$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Neo goes on
# Next comes the FINAL server: Mach 1337!

Mach 1337 keeps on tracing IP

Jump Hosts

Paris : 52.47.163.42
Mumbai: 13.232.211.39

ssh -J mumbai,paris london
# Connects to mumbai via london->paris

Jump hosts + Proxy
# LIVE

Step 0: Create ~/.ssh/config file

Step 1: $ ssh -J mumbai,paris london -TD 4711

Step 2: Profit!
